%% Define the prefix predicate that holds iff its second argument 
%% is a prefix of the first argument. 

%% E.g. prefix("Hello world", "Hello") is true, while prefix("Hello world", "wor") is not.

%% Define an analogous predicate for suffixes.
%% E.g. suffix("Hello world", "world") is true, while suffix("Hello world", "Hello") is not.

%% Define the infix predicate that holds iff its second argument is a substring 
%% of the first argument. (Hint: an infix is a prefix of a suffix.)

%% Define the overlap predicate that holds iff its two argument strings actually overlap, 
%% i.e. either one is an infix of the other, or oneâ€™s prefix is a suffix of the other.
